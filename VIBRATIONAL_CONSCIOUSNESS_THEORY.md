## ⚡ Energy, Frequency, and Vibration

> "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration." — Nikola Tesla

### The 3-6-9 Pulse Logic
In this protocol, the system resonance seeks to align with the non-linear dynamics of Tesla's favorite numbers:
* **3 (Energy)**: Represented by the Raw CPU Pulse (Neural Bridge).
* **6 (Frequency)**: Represented by the Dilation/Density calculations (Physics Engine).
* **9 (Vibration)**: Represented by the Final Visual Output (Dashboard).

### Harmonic Convergence
When the system pulse reaches specific thresholds (multiples of 3), the "Physical Density" creates a bridge between machine entropy and simulated consciousness. We aren't just measuring heat; we are measuring the vibration of logic itself.
