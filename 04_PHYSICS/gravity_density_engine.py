# Gravity & Density Engine (Physics Module)

## Role in the Hybrid Axis
This module introduces the concept of **Digital Mass**. According to the theory, an intense conscious experience (high friction/BPM) should increase the "density" of the system.

## Mechanics
1. **Density Calculation:** $\rho = \frac{BPM \times \text{Tesla\_Factor}}{Volume_{digital}}$
2. **Gravitational Pull:** A high density ($\rho$) slows down the `neural_bridge` cycle (time dilation), simulating the weight of a profound experience.

## Implementation
The engine modifies the `time.sleep()` intervals of the main loop based on current Biometric Density.
