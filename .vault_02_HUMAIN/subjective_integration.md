# Subjective Integration Protocol (02_HUMAN)

## Objective
To bridge the gap between **Biometric Data** (collected by Kinetic-RNG) and **Subjective Experience** (your internal state). This ensures the "Hybrid Axis" is balanced between data and consciousness.

## Protocol Steps
1. **Biological Feed:** Ensure Apple Health data is extracted via `bio_extractor.py`.
2. **Resonance Check:** Run `nexus_launcher.py` and listen to the frequencies.
3. **Intentionality Input:** When a "Spark" is detected, manually record your current mental focus.

## Subjective Log Template
- **Timestamp:** [Correlate with Anamnesis Log]
- **Internal State:** (e.g., Meditation, Intense Work, Altered State)
- **Synesthesia Level:** Did the audio frequency match your internal energy?
- **Tesla Calibration:** Does the current 3-6-9 resonance feel aligned?

## Goal
To reach a state where the **External Echo** (Turing-Landau) reflects the **Internal Truth** (Human).
