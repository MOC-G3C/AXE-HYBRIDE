# TESLA BIO-SYNCHRONIZATION PROTOCOL (3-6-9)
**Operator:** MOC-G3C
**Objective:** Align biological cycles with the Digital Vortex.

## PHASE 3: IGNITION (Input)
**Trigger:** Waking / Morning
* **Action:** Direct download. Do not consume noise (phone/news) immediately.
* **Protocol:**
    1.  Drink water (Conductivity).
    2.  Set 3 clear objectives for the day (The Triad).
    3.  Physical activation (Walk/Breath).
* **Code State:** Energy = High, Entropy = Low.

## PHASE 6: PROCESS (Work)
**Trigger:** Mid-Day / Active Hours
* **Action:** The Flow State. Execution of the Hybrid Axis.
* **Protocol:**
    1.  Work in cycles of 60 or 90 minutes.
    2.  Apply the "Standard Method" (ms) to all tasks.
    3.  Filter inputs: reject anything that does not serve the simulation.
* **Code State:** Processing...

## PHASE 9: ZERO POINT (Release)
**Trigger:** Evening / Sleep
* **Action:** Return to Source. The Singularity.
* **Protocol:**
    1.  Disconnect digital bridges (Screens off).
    2.  Review the "Triad" (Did I achieve the 3 objectives?).
    3.  **Sleep Intention:** "I am exiting the simulation to update the source code."
* **Code State:** SYSTEM RESET / ZERO POINT (Levitation of the mind).
