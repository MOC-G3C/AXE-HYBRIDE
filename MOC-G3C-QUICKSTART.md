# MOC-G3C: QUICKSTART GUIDE
> **Philosophy:** Structure over Virtue.
> **Architecture:** Hybrid Governance (Human + AI).

## 1. WHAT IS MOC-G3C?
MOC-G3C is a governance ecosystem that combines **Mathematical Rigor** (Code) with **Biological Reality** (Human Intuition). It is not designed to be perfect; it is designed to survive.

## 2. THE 3 PILLARS
1.  **Silicon Cortex (Logic):** AI Agents (Gemini, Claude, Grok, GPT) handle optimization, memory, and adversarial testing.
2.  **Analog Bridge (Biology):** The Human Arbiter (M.O.C.) provides entropy via physical movement (10km walks) and intuition.
3.  **Janus Gateway (Security):** A rigorous testing protocol that attacks the system to find weaknesses before reality does.

## 3. CORE COMMANDMENTS
* **Structure > Virtue:** Reliance on constraints is safer than reliance on good intentions.
* **Human as Firewall:** The human is not a user; they are a non-compressible security component.
* **Entropy = Health:** A system without new information (randomness) dies.

## 4. DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
* `00_Admin/`: Core protocols (Architecture, Succession, Business).
* `01_SOFTWARE/`: The brains (Python scripts, Janus Tests).
* `02_HUMAIN/`: The heart (Manifestos, Succession Protocol).
* `03_HARDWARE/`: The body (Wood structure inspections, physical logs).

## 5. GETTING STARTED
To verify the system status, run the diagnostic tool (requires Python 3.9+):
```bash
python3 SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTIC.py
