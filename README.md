# AXE HYBRIDE - Turing-Landau Protocol

This project explores the intersection of system entropy and consciousness modeling through a biological-to-digital bridge.

## 🛠 Features

### 1. System Resonance Mode
The **Neural Bridge** generates a pulse based on real-time CPU load. This "Machine BPM" drives the entropy of the entire system.
* **Low Load**: Stable Cyan pulse (Calm).
* **High Load**: Orange/Red pulse (Active/Critical Stress).

### 2. Live Monitoring
* **Neural Bridge**: Core engine calculating physical density and system dilation.
* **Consciousness Dashboard**: Real-time visual feedback of system resonance and pulse stability.

### 3. Automated Energy Analytics
A daily reporting system runs at **23:50** to analyze performance.
* **Daily Reports**: Saved in `01_SOFTWARE/Kinetic-RNG/Archives`.
* **Trend Analysis**: Compares current pulse averages with previous days.
* **macOS Notifications**: Visual alerts upon report generation.

## 🚀 Quick Launch

1. **Start System**: Double-click `launch_axis.command` on the Desktop.
2. **Check Archives**: Double-click `check_archives.command` on the Desktop.
3. **Manual Graph**: Run `python3 01_SOFTWARE/Kybernetes-Governance/plot_results.py`.
