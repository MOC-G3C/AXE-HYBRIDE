# 🧬 THE HYBRID AXIS (L'AXE HYBRIDE)
> *Where Biology meets Digital Governance.*

This project is not merely a code repository. It is a recursive interface between the **Operator (Human)** and the **Machine (System)**. The objective is to synchronize biological rhythms with software execution to maximize longevity, stability, and creativity.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project is divided into 4 fundamental pillars:

### 1. 🧠 01_SOFTWARE (The Brain)
Contains intelligence and governance protocols.
- **Kybernetes-Governance:** The system's council of laws.
- **Entropic-Zoo:** Complex and chaotic simulations.
- **Bio-Guard:** The security module that locks these folders if the Operator is fatigued.

### 2. ❤️ 02_HUMAIN (The Heart)
The single point of biological truth.
- **BIO_CALIBRATION.md:** The source file read by machines to determine the Operator's state (**Optimized** / **Depleted**).
- **Strategy:** Documentation regarding sleep, stress management, and DNA preservation.

### 3. 👁️ 03_HARDWARE (The Body)
The physical and sensory interface.
- **Tesla Resonance:** Frequency vibration scripts (3-6-9).
- **Visual Core:** Screen light adaptation based on fatigue levels.
- **Pulse Bridge:** Arduino connection for real-time biometrics.

### 4. 🌌 04_PHYSICS (The Laws)
The universal simulation engine.
- **Digital Gravity:** Heavy calculations requiring maximum mental stability (protected by Bio-Guard).

## 🛡️ The Bio-Guard Protocol

This system is equipped with active security logic:

1. The system **reads** the file `02_HUMAIN/BIO_CALIBRATION.md`.
2. If the state is **"DEPLETED"**:
   - ⛔ **Access Denied** to governance modifications.
   - ⛔ **Prohibition** of launching physical/entropic simulations.
   - 💡 **Hardware** switches to "Recovery" mode (Soft light / Low noise).
3. If the state is **"OPTIMIZED"**:
   - ✅ **Full Access** unlocked.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To verify the global health status of the Hybrid Axis, launch the master script at the root:

```bash
python3 SYSTEM_DIAGNOSTIC.py
