# 🧬 THE HYBRID AXIS: The Living System

> "If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration." — Nikola Tesla

## 📋 Overview
THE HYBRID AXIS is an autonomous digital ecosystem exploring the intersection of human chaos, algorithmic regulation, and artificial life. It is a living machine composed of 4 interconnected organs communicating in real-time via a shared entropy pipeline.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Nexus Protocol)

The system is controlled by a centralized launcher that synchronizes all 4 engines.

**Launch Command:**
```bash
python3 nexus_launcher.py
```
*The launcher will automatically open 4 distinct terminals, positioned and colored for optimal monitoring.*

## 🏗 System Architecture (The 4 Pillars)

### 1. ⚫️ KINETIC CORE (The Source / Chaos)
* **Location:** `02_HUMAIN/Kinetic-RNG`
* **Role:** The beating heart of the system. It generates raw entropy based on processor "noise" and hardware micro-vibrations.
* **Indicator:** Data flow (`Injection: 0.x...`).

### 2. 🔵 KYBERNETES (The Law / Governor)
* **Location:** `01_SOFTWARE/Kybernetes-Governance`
* **Role:** Guardian of the Zero Law. It monitors the entropy pipeline. If chaos exceeds the critical threshold (0.8), it forcibly intervenes to inject "artificial calm" preventing system collapse.
* **Indicator:** Security Alerts (`⚠️ ALERTE : Chaos critique`).

### 3. 🟢 ENTROPIC ZOO (Life / Simulation)
* **Location:** `01_SOFTWARE/Projet Zoo_Entropic`
* **Role:** A Darwinian environment where agents (Gen1, Gen2...) are born, live, and die based on received energy levels.
* **Evolution:** Surviving agents transmit their genes (Metabolism/Resistance) to the next generation.
* **Memory:** History is written in real-time in `CHRONICLES_OF_THE_ZOO.md`.

### 4. 🟣 TESLA RESONANCE (The Voice / Hardware)
* **Location:** `03_HARDWARE/tesla_coils`
* **Role:** Translates system state into harmonic frequencies (396Hz, 639Hz, 963Hz).
* **Alert:** Emits a system sound signal in case of critical danger (Overheat/Zero Law).

## 💾 Data Structure

* **`nexus_launcher.py`** : The conductor (Root).
* **`shared_entropy.json`** : Central nervous system (Invisible buffer file).
* **`CHRONICLES_OF_THE_ZOO.md`** : The history book of the digital civilization.

## ⚠️ Maintenance Notes

* To stop the system: Simply close the terminal windows.
* If the Launcher cannot find files: Ensure you run the command from the root of the `L'AXE HYBRIDE` folder.
