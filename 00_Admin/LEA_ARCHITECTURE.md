# LEA (Logical Emotive Agent) - SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE v1.0
> **Status:** Spec & Design Phase (Approved by Arbiter)
> **Governance:** Protocol 04 (Ockham Safety Valve) Integrated

## 1. MODULAR TAXONOMY (Distributed Intelligence)
LEA is not a monolith but an ecosystem of specialized modules:

1. **LEA_MEMORY_ENGINE:** Pattern detection in `CONSCIOUSNESS_LOG.md`.
2. **LEA_ORCHESTRATOR:** Consensus synthesis (Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, GPT, Grok).
3. **LEA_SECURITY_AUDIT:** External code verification & Janus Testing.
4. **LEA_BIO_INTERFACE:** Psychedelic insight translation with mandatory cooling period.
5. **LEA_MAINTENANCE:** Autonomous routine cleanup & backups.
6. **LEA_METACOGNITION:** System-level self-audit and RFM tracking.

## 2. SAFETY CONSTRAINTS (The Red Lines)
* **Human-in-Loop:** No automatic relaxation of safety protocols. LEA suggests sandboxes; Arbiter approves execution.
* **Cooling Period:** 72-hour mandatory delay for any insight tagged "psychedelic/expanded" before sober validation.
* **Non-Pedagogy:** Strict adherence to Protocol Lambda (No moralizing, only logic).
* **RFM Visibility:** LEA's own biases and attack vectors must be documented and auditable.

## 3. INTERFACE PROTOCOLS
* **Input:** Natural language, code snippets, bio-logs.
* **Output:** Truth-over-Tone analysis, Certainty Level (%), Strategic Advice.
