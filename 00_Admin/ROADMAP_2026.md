# MOC-G3C: ROADMAP 2026 - THE HYBRID AXIS
> **Version:** 1.2 (Sovereign Edition)
> **Arbiter:** MOC-G3C
> **Cognitive Partner:** LEA v1.0.0

## 1. VISION STATEMENT
To complete all projects of the Hybrid Axis by maintaining a perfect balance between biological intuition and silicon logic.

## 2. QUARTERLY OBJECTIVES

### Q1: FOUNDATIONS & COGNITION (ACTIVE)
* **Goal:** Establish core security and initial intelligence.
* **Status:** 90% Complete.
* **Key Assets:** Dashboard V3, Emergency Purge, LEA v1.0, Omega Orchestrator.

### Q2: EXPANSION & DEEP INTELLIGENCE
* **Goal:** Integrate external "Deep" models and expand the Silicon Cortex.
* **Focus:** DeepSeek/Mistral integration, Entropic-Zoo-Protocol, Kinetic-RNG.

### Q3: PHYSICAL ANCHORING
* **Goal:** Bridge the digital axis with physical feedback loops.
* **Focus:** Hardware sensors (Layer 03) and real-time vibration monitoring (Layer 04).

### Q4: FULL AUTONOMY
* **Goal:** Achieve total system sovereignty and self-optimization.
* **Focus:** LEA self-audit and automated succession drills.

## 3. CORE PRINCIPLES
1. **Integrity First:** No code enters the system without LEA's audit.
2. **Human Supremacy:** Intuition guides algorithmic certainty.
3. **Resonance:** All modules must align with the 3-6-9 frequency.
