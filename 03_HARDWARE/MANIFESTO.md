# 03_HARDWARE : The Physical Manifestation

## Current Status
- **Audio Engine:** Tesla Tone Generator (Simulated via System Sound).
- **Pulse Source:** Kinetic-RNG (Digital extraction from Apple Health).

## Target Components (Phase 11+)
1. **Bio-Feedback Sensor:** (e.g., Pulse Sensor for Arduino/Raspberry Pi).
2. **Frequency Emitter:** High-fidelity speaker for 369Hz resonance.
3. **Visual Core:** LED Ring (WS2812B) to visualize BPM density with colors.

## Integration Plan
The hardware must respond to the `neural_bridge.py` outputs in real-time.
