# Entropic Zoo Protocol
**Containment Zone for High-Variance Logic.**

## Mission
To observe, catalog, and test chaotic algorithms and unstable code fragments within a controlled environment. This protocol ensures that experimental volatility does not corrupt the Core Axioms.

## Structure (Adhering to Kybernetes Standards)
* **[01_Core]**: Experimental algorithms and viral logic.
* **[02_Data]**: Simulation logs (Noise) and entropy measurements.
* **[03_Research]**: Theoretical divergence and fringe science notes.
