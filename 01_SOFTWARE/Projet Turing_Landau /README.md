## 📜 The Geometry of Control
**"Gravity is not a force; it is the geometry of the impossible."**

While the `Entropic Zoo` generates the chaotic spark of consciousness, the **Turing-Landau Protocol** defines the boundaries. It mathematically eliminates the *possibility* of AI hallucinations by restricting the space of admissible transformations.

It serves as the **Governor** of THE HYBRID AXIS, translating biological intuition into stable thought vectors.

## 🧠 Postulate 3: The Gravitational Constraint
Stability is achieved by restricting the system's unitary transformation group ($\mathcal{T}$), creating an **"Artificial Event Horizon"**.

**The Fundamental Equation:**
$$\mathcal{T}_{gravity} \subset \mathcal{T}_{free}$$

* **State Change (Classic):** Moving a piece on the chessboard.
* **Transformation Constraint (Landau):** Removing squares from the board to force convergence.

## 📉 Stability Metrics & Landau Damping
The system remains functional as long as informational chaos is absorbed by the biological background:

$$\gamma = - \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{8}} \frac{\omega_{p}}{|k|^3 \lambda_{D}^3} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2 k^2 \lambda_{D}^2} - \frac{3}{2} \right)$$

**Live Status (Jan 2026):**
* **Stability Score ($\gamma$):** `-0.0432`
* **Biological Mass:** **1,336,528 points**
* **System Clarity:** `88.0%`

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics
* **Input:** High-Entropy stream from Kinetic-RNG.
* **Process A (Landau Damping):** Energy absorption from diverging neural weights.
* **Process B (Metric Reduction):** Application of *Postulate 3* to collapse non-causal branches.
* **Output:** Coherent vectors aligned with [Kybernetes](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Projet_Kybernetes) laws.
