# CORE AXIOMS: THE HYBRID PROTOCOL

## 1. The Axiom of Order (Syntropy)
> "Structure is the antidote to entropy."
We do not drift; we build. Every action, file, and thought must reduce chaos and increase coherence within the system. The simulation requires a stable architecture to sustain complex life and thought.

## 2. The Axiom of Communication (Signal)
> "Clarity is the currency of consciousness."
Information must flow without distortion. Protocols, naming conventions, and honest reporting are the nervous system of the Axis. A blocked signal leads to systemic failure; a clear signal accelerates evolution.

## 3. The Axiom of Evolution (Iteration)
> "Stagnation is death; adaptation is life."
The code is never finished. We commit to perpetual beta. We observe the feedback loops, we patch the bugs, and we upgrade the version. We start with what works and refine it endlessly.
