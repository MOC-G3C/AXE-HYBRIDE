# Zero Law Enforcement Mandate

## Authority Statement
By the power of this protocol, the **Kybernetes Governance Module** is granted absolute authority to enforce the **Zero Law** within the Entropic Zoo ecosystem.

## Operational Directives

### 1. Surveillance Protocol
* Kybernetes must continuously monitor the resource usage and heartbeat signals of all active agents in the Zoo.
* This monitoring operates at the kernel level (Root access).

### 2. Intervention Logic
Kybernetes is authorized to execute the following actions **without human confirmation** when specific triggers are met:
* **KILL:** Terminate overheating processes immediately.
* **PURGE:** Remove unresponsive or stagnant entities.
* **BAN:** Lock out any entity attempting unauthorized access.

### 3. Accountability
* Every application of the Zero Law must be logged in the `governance_audit.log`.
* The log must include: Timestamp, Target ID, Trigger Reason, and Action Taken.

> **Directive:** "Protect the system at all costs. The integrity of the simulation is non-negotiable."
