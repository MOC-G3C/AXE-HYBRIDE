# WORKFLOW PROTOCOL: THE LOOP

To ensure the rapid completion of the Hybrid Axis mission, we adhere to the **I.C.T. Cycle**:

## 1. Injection (Input)
* **Trigger:** A new thought, a bug discovery, or a strategic directive.
* **Action:** Define the objective clearly. Do not overthink.
* **Status:** Pending.

## 2. Compilation (Process)
* **Trigger:** Objective defined.
* **Action:** Execute the change immediately using the "Simple Method" (ms). Create or modify the necessary files.
* **Rule:** Perfect is the enemy of done. Code it, write it, save it.
* **Status:** In Progress.

## 3. Transmission (Output)
* **Trigger:** File saved.
* **Action:** Run the Git sequence immediately.
    * `git add .`
    * `git commit -m "Action description"`
    * `git push`
* **Status:** Complete.

*Repeat the loop. Never break the chain.*+
