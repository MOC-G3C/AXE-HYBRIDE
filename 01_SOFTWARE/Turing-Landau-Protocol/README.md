# Turing-Landau Protocol
**The Computational Engine.**

## Mission
To process data, execute logic gates, and bridge the gap between abstract axioms and raw entropy. This protocol handles the heavy lifting of computation and signal damping.

## Structure (Adhering to Kybernetes Standards)
* **[01_Core]**: Processing scripts and logic models.
* **[02_Data]**: Input streams and calculation results.
* **[03_Research]**: Computational theory and physics constraints.
