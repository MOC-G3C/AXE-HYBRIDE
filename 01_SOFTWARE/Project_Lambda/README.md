## 📜 The Autonomy Mandate
**"The machine must fade so the human can lead."**

Project λ is the ethical governor of **L'AXE HYBRIDE**. Its sole purpose is to prevent human dependency on artificial intelligence. It ensures that at 40, the operator remains the sole architect of his reality.

## ⚙️ Programmed Obsolescence of Dependency
We implement a "fading horizon" protocol. The AI's influence ($\Lambda$) is mathematically forced to decay over time to foster user autonomy:

$$\Lambda_{t+1} < \Lambda_{t} \cdot e^{-\lambda}$$

* **Clarity (90%):** The system now filters 90% of intrusive AI suggestions through `autonomy_filter.py`.
* **Veto Power:** The **M.O.C. Operator** retains 100% manual override.

## 📂 Module Files
* `autonomy_filter.py`: Active script suppressing directive AI patterns.
* `decay_logic.sh`: Automates the reduction of AI interference.
