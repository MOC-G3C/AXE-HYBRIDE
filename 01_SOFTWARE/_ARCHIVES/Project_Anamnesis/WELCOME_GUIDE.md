# 🏛️ PROJECT ANAMNESIS: THE MEMORY VAULT
**Welcome to the core of our governance system.**

## 1. What is this repository?
Project Anamnesis is the "Digital Library" of **L'AXE HYBRIDE**. Its purpose is to store our rules, our history, and our ethical standards to ensure we never repeat past mistakes.

## 2. Quick Navigation (2-Minute Guide)
To understand the project quickly, follow this path:
* **Step 1:** Read the [**White_Paper.md**](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/Project-Anamnesis/blob/main/White_Paper.md). This is our master plan and defines our 4 Pillars.
* **Step 2:** Check the **Protocols**. These documents explain the rules we follow to keep the system safe and stable.
* **Step 3:** Review the **Archives**. This is where we store the results of our past tests and simulations.

## 3. Our Golden Rule: Simplicity
Everything in this vault must be written in clear, direct language. If a document is too complex to understand, it must be simplified. Transparency is our primary safety feature.

## 4. Final Authority
Remember that all data here is for support only. The final decision always belongs to the **Human Operator** via the Anthropic Vault.
