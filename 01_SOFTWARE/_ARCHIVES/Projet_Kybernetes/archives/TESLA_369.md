# Tesla's 3-6-9 Theory & AI Architecture
**Topic:** Esoteric Physics / Mathematics
**Status:** Research Note

## 1. The Core Concept
"If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6 and 9, then you would have the key to the universe." - Nikola Tesla.

* **Circle (360°):** 3 + 6 + 0 = 9.
* **Triangle (180°):** 1 + 8 + 0 = 9.
* **The Pattern:** Nature seems to follow a binary doubling system (1, 2, 4, 8, 7, 5...), but 3, 6, and 9 are separate, governing the flow of energy.

## 2. Hypothesis for AI (Project Kybernetes)
Can we structure our AI interactions based on this triad?
* **3:** The Input (The Prompt / The User).
* **6:** The Processing (The Logic / The Hidden Layers).
* **9:** The Output (The Synthesis / The Result).

## 3. Future Testing
* Experiment with prompt structures divisible by 3.
* Analyze the resonance of repeating patterns in code generation.
