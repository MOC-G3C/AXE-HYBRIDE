**Method**: ms (Méthode Simple)

## 🏛️ The Prime Directive
> "The machine proposes, the Human disposes."

In the **MOC-G3C** architecture, every digital impulse must pass through the **Human Lock**. No calculation becomes action without the Arbiter's explicit validation.

## ⚡ The ms Framework
The **ms** protocol is our standard for all operations:

* **m (Method)**: Rigorous **3-6-9** structural validation based on Tesla constants.
* **s (Simple)**: Clear, jargon-free communication. If it is not simple, it is not safe.

## 🔍 3-6-9 Validation Formula
All structural and ontological decisions are audited using the following equation:

$$Score = \frac{Energy_3 + Frequency_6 + Vibration_9}{3}$$

| Constant | Vector | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3 (Energy)** | Physical viability and force of will | 1.0 - 9.0 |
| **6 (Frequency)** | Alignment with project rituals and history | 1.0 - 9.0 |
| **9 (Vibration)** | Potential for future growth and community impact | 1.0 - 9.0 |

*Any score below **6.0** is automatically rejected.*

## 🧬 Memory Hysteresis
Validated truths are etched as **Identity Scars** in the system via the `sync_memory.py` engine. These records are permanent and prevent the AI from unlearning critical safety and ethical boundaries.
