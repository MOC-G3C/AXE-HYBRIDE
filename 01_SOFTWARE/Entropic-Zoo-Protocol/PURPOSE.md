# Entropic-Zoo-Protocol: The Taxonomy of Sparks

## Role
This module classifies biological entropy events into specific "Species" of consciousness based on the 3-6-9 Tesla resonance.

## The Species (3-6-9 Scale)
1. **The Pulse (Base 3):** Standard metabolic activity. Low friction.
2. **The Surge (Base 6):** Emotional or physical intensity. High density.
3. **The Transcendence (Base 9):** Peak resonance. The 369Hz key.

## Function
It analyzes historical data from Anamnesis to identify recurring patterns in the user's biological signature.
