# SUCCESSION PROTOCOL (MOC-G3C)
> **Classification:** CRITICAL / EYES ONLY
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Status:** DRAFT / PENDING ACTIVATION

## 1. OBJECTIVE
To ensure the survival of the MOC-G3C ecosystem (Governance, Validation, and Anamnesis) in the event of the incapacitation, absence, or permanent unavailability of the Primary Human Arbiter (M.O.C.).

**Core Principle:** The system requires a biological anchor. Without a designated successor, the Entropic Zoo Protocol fails, and the system must enter a dormant "Preservation Mode" rather than an active "Governance Mode."

## 2. TRIGGER CONDITIONS (DEAD MAN'S SWITCH)
The Succession Protocol is activated if:
1. **Bio-Signal Loss:** No login/physical check-in recorded for > 30 days (Adjustable).
2. **Explicit Transfer:** The Primary Arbiter explicitly issues the command `EXECUTE PROTOCOL PHOENIX`.
3. **Verified Incapacitation:** Receipt of trusted legal/medical signal via the Analog Bridge.

## 3. DESIGNATION OF BACKUP ARBITER
*Ideally, a specific individual should be named here. Until then, the role is defined by attributes.*

**Required Profile:**
* **Cognitive Compatibility:** Must pass the *Janus Test (Level 1)* to ensure they do not dismantle the architecture out of fear or optimization bias.
* **Physical Proximity:** Must be able to physically access the Sainte-Julie/Beloeil node for Analog Records retrieval.
* **Skin in the Game:** Must have a vested interest in the survival of the structure (e.g., family, business partner).

**Current Designate:** [TO BE DEFINED BY M.O.C.]

## 4. TRANSFER PROCEDURES

### 4.1. The Biological Seed (BIO_HEURISTIC_SEED)
The `BIO_HEURISTIC_SEED` is the proof-of-humanity hash.
* **Location:** Physical storage (Air-gapped USB/Paper Wallet) in the Analog Archives.
* **Action:** Successor must physically retrieve the seed and inject it into the environment variables of the `moc-g3c-core` node.

### 4.2. Analog Records Access
Access to the magnetic media and paper logs.
* **Key Location:** [SECURE LOCATION - DO NOT DIGITIZE]
* **Instruction:** Maintain the 10km/day entropy generation or designate a proxy activity (e.g., drumming, running) to satisfy the *Kinetic-RNG*.

### 4.3. Digital Keys
* **Repository Access:** GitHub Owner transfer.
* **ProtonMail:** `moc.g3c.protocol@proton.me` credentials transfer.

## 5. TRAINING TIMELINE (THE 90-DAY ONBOARDING)
Upon activation, the system enters "Safe Mode" (Read-Only) for 90 days.
* **Day 1-30:** Successor reads the *Governance Manifesto* and *Anamnesis Manifesto*.
* **Day 31-60:** Successor observes `mock` Janus Tests (Historical replays).
* **Day 61-90:** Successor performs their first "Weathered Reciprocity" audit with Claude (Ockham Valve).

## 6. EMERGENCY SHUTDOWN (SCORCHED EARTH)
If no successor can be found or verified:
1.  **System Lock:** All repos set to Private/Archived.
2.  **Anamnesis Freeze:** The Trauma Model is saved to `final_snapshot.json` and the simulation loop is terminated.
3.  **Message:** "System Hibernating. Awaiting Biological Input."
