# Biological Rhythms and Longevity

## Biological Age vs Chronological Age
- **Chronological Age:** A fixed mathematical value based on time.
- **Biological Age:** A variable state reflecting the actual wear and tear of cells and organs.

## Key Preservation Factors

### 1. Sleep as System Maintenance
- Sleep is a critical "repair mode," not a sign of laziness.
- **Glymphatic Cleaning:** The brain removes metabolic waste during deep sleep.
- **Cellular Regeneration:** Growth hormones peak to repair tissues and DNA.

### 2. Stress Management and Telomeres
- Low stress levels prevent the overproduction of cortisol.
- **Telomere Protection:** Maintaining a calm state preserves the protective caps of chromosomes, slowing down cellular aging.

### 3. Individual Chronotypes
- Every individual has a unique biological "time lapse."
- Respecting your natural internal clock (chronotype) instead of following rigid social schedules reduces systemic inflammation.

## Conclusion
Optimizing the "software" (mindset/rest) is the most effective way to preserve the "hardware" (body) within the Hybrid Axis framework.
