# Energetic Vibrations and 3-6-9 Framework

## The Tesla Influence
- Integration of Nikola Tesla's 3-6-9 theory into biological systems.
- **Frequency Alignment:** Studying how specific Hertz frequencies (like Solfeggio frequencies) impact cellular health and mental state.

## The 3-6-9 Protocol (ms)
| Element | Function | Focus |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3 (Energy)** | Vital Input | Breathwork, nutrition, and raw energy management. |
| **6 (Frequency)** | Balance | Sound therapy and external vibrational stabilization. |
| **9 (Vibration)** | Manifestation | Achieving high-state consciousness and cellular harmony. |

## Practical Application
- **Vibrational Quality:** Documenting how low-stress environments preserve biological integrity.
- **Daily Cycles:** Aligning rest and activity with mathematical patterns to reduce systemic "noise."
