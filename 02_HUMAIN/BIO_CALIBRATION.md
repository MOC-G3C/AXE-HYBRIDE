# Bio-Calibration: Performance & Sleep Correlation

## Overview
This protocol monitors the synergy between biological recovery and technical output. It treats the human body as the primary "hardware" that must be calibrated before interacting with external systems.

## Sleep-to-Code Correlation Matrix (ms)
| Biological State | Rest Quality | Coding Performance | Bug Frequency |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Optimized** | > 8h / High REM | Peak logic flow & rapid prototyping | Minimal |
| **Standard** | 6-7h / Average | Steady progress / Maintenance tasks | Low |
| **Depleted** | < 5h / Interrupted | High friction / Syntax errors | High |

## Bio-Hacking Protocols
- **Circadian Coding:** Schedule complex architectural tasks only during peak neurotransmitter windows (post-REM sleep).
- **Stress-Load Balancing:** If resting heart rate is elevated, shift tasks from "01_SOFTWARE" (high cognitive load) to "03_HARDWARE" (tactile/physical assembly).
- **Frequency Shielding:** Use 432Hz or 528Hz soundscapes during deep focus sessions to maintain cellular resonance (Tesla 3-6-9 alignment).

## Calibration Logs
- **Internal Clock:** Record perceived age vs. chronological age daily.
- **System Sync:** Ensure biological readiness before initiating "Neural Bridge" protocols in folder 03.
