# Bio-Calibration & Hybrid Interface

## Objective
To quantify the impact of sleep-first recovery on cognitive output and biological preservation within the Hybrid Axis framework.

## Sleep/Code Correlation (ms)
| Metric | Focus | System Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recovery State** | 7-9h high-quality sleep | Repairs DNA and flushes neurotoxins. |
| **Cognitive Burst** | Focus window after rest | Maximum hardware performance without cortisol spikes. |
| **Code Efficiency** | Output per energy unit | High-quality logic with minimal "friction" or bugs. |

## Bio-Hacking Bridge (02 -> 03)
- **Pulse Monitoring:** Tracking resting heart rate as a stress benchmark.
- **Sleep Cycles:** Documenting REM and Deep Sleep stages via external sensors.
- **Neural Load:** Assessing mental fatigue levels before transitioning to hardware tasks.

## Maintenance Checklist
- [ ] Verify baseline biological integrity (rested state).
- [ ] Align current task with the 3-6-9 frequency protocol.
- [ ] Record any "time lapse" discrepancies (feeling younger/older than chronological age).
