# Bio-Calibration Protocol

## Hardware Baseline (Organic)
- **Sleep Optimization:** Tracking deep sleep cycles vs. cognitive clarity.
- **Stress Resilience:** Monitoring the absence of cortisol spikes through meditative states.
- **Biological Age Markers:** Subjective and objective data on vitality vs. chronological time.

## 3-6-9 Integration
- **Morning (3):** Energy activation and breathing.
- **Mid-day (6):** Frequency stabilization (Solfege/Tesla).
- **Evening (9):** Total system reset and cellular repair.
